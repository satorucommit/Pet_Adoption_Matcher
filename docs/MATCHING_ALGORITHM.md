# Pet Matching Algorithm Documentation

This document explains the pet matching algorithm used in PetMatch to connect adopters with suitable pets based on their lifestyle and preferences.

## Overview

The PetMatch algorithm analyzes multiple factors to calculate compatibility scores between adopters and pets. The algorithm considers both adopter preferences and pet characteristics to ensure successful, long-term matches.

## Algorithm Components

### 1. Lifestyle Compatibility (30% weight)

Assesses how well a pet fits into the adopter's daily routine and living situation.

**Factors:**
- Activity level match
- Living space compatibility
- Time availability
- Experience with pets
- Household composition (children, other pets)

### 2. Personality Matching (25% weight)

Evaluates the compatibility between adopter and pet personalities.

**Factors:**
- Energy level alignment
- Social needs compatibility
- Temperament matching
- Behavioral preferences

### 3. Physical Requirements (20% weight)

Considers physical aspects that affect the match quality.

**Factors:**
- Size compatibility
- Age preference match
- Grooming requirements
- Exercise needs

### 4. Practical Considerations (15% weight)

Addresses logistical and practical aspects of pet ownership.

**Factors:**
- Cost of care
- Medical needs
- Training requirements
- Special accommodations

### 5. Preferences (10% weight)

Incorporates specific adopter preferences.

**Factors:**
- Breed preferences
- Color preferences
- Gender preferences
- Specific traits

## Scoring System

### Compatibility Score Calculation

The algorithm calculates a compatibility score between 0-100 using the following formula:

```
Compatibility Score = 
  (Lifestyle × 0.30) + 
  (Personality × 0.25) + 
  (Physical × 0.20) + 
  (Practical × 0.15) + 
  (Preferences × 0.10)
```

### Score Interpretation

- **90-100**: Excellent match - High compatibility in all areas
- **75-89**: Good match - Strong compatibility with minor considerations
- **60-74**: Fair match - Compatible but may require adjustments
- **40-59**: Poor match - Significant differences, careful consideration needed
- **0-39**: Incompatible - Not recommended for this adopter

- Flag for manual review

#### Conflicting Information
When data sources provide conflicting information:
- Prioritize most recent data
- Weight sources by reliability
- Request additional information when possible

#### Special Circumstances
For unique situations:
- Allow manual override by shelter staff
